# React Native Expo Template

## Introduction

This repository serves as a **boilerplate** or **template** for kickstarting React Native projects using Expo. It includes a pre-configured theme toggle for dark and light modes and a basic setup that adheres to best practices in modern mobile app development. This template aims to reduce the initial setup time and provides a clean and organized structure for both new and experienced developers.

- Node.js (LTS version)
- npm or yarn (as a package manager)
- Expo CLI
  ```bash
  npm install -g expo-cli
  ```
